# Valorant Comp Maker

## Objective:
The objective of this project was to create a script in C++ that could generate the best possible team combinations based on input given by the user.

### How to use:

#### Step 1: Open the Executable Directory
Open the directory called [Executable](./Executable).

#### Step 2: Download the script
Now you will need to create a directory inside your computer and download the file to that directory. You can download the file in two ways:

1. **Option 1: Using the shortcut**
   - You can press "Control + Shift + S" to download the file directly.

2. **Option 2: Download using the menu**
   - Click on the file.
   - Click on the three dots on the top left.
   - Click on the option "Download file".

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Due to the fact that I am still "new" as a developer, the antivirus may find the program as a virus and block the download. You are free to not download it if you don't feel comfortable with it. There is always the source code in this repository if you want to check it by yourself.

### Step 3: Input Data
To properly use the script, you will need to add two files to the same directory as the executable. Please refer to the README.md file inside the [Executable](./Executable) directory.

### Step 4: Run the program!
Answer the questions and have fun using the program!

## The script:
If you are looking for the creation process of the application, please refer to the README.md file inside the [Code](./Code) directory.
