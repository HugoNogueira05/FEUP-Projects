> ⚠️ **Warning:** Due to the fact that I am still "new" as a developer the antivirus may find the program as a virus and block the download. You are free to not download it if you don't feel comfortable with it. There is always the source code in this repository if you want to check by yourself.

</div>

<div style="background-color: #C2B8B2; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
<strong>Step 3: Input Data</strong><br>
