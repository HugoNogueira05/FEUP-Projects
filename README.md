# FEUP-Projects
Projects that I've developed alone or with help using what I learned in the University.
The objective is to display all the programming languages I've learned during classes obviously, some projects might be more elaborate than others, most will still be WIP.
Every project has in it's file the starting date aswell as everyone who took part in it's development
Everyone is free to use every code to help in their own projects, but beware that straigt plagerism is neither correct nor a good way to learn coding.
I will try to explain every thought process behind the code and try to document it while doing it, to help some person that might be looking for help in any subject.
Any sugestions/ help that mighty want to communicate, please use my email: hugonogueira055@gmail.com
