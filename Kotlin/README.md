# Project Origin
This project was created to use in a presentation about Kotlin.
Another important point that came into the creation of this small project, was the idea that a programming language could also fit into the UN's sustainable development goals, and so, the EcoCalculator was born.
> [!NOTE]
> This project was created based on 0 previous knowledge of kotlin and therefore it is very bare-bones and inefficient
With the previous note in mind:
# What does this code do?
This code functions based on user input, it gets three vital informations:
- The car type that the user intends on using, being either Gasoline , Diesel or Electric.
- The distance that the user wants to travel in Km.
- The average consumption of the vehicle in question.
After the program gets this informations, it then calculates how much money the suer will spend based on the prices of fuel of november 2023 as well as how much money the user would have saved if he was using an electric car(This option only works if the car type chosen is not electric).
Finally the program also calculates the average emissions that the user's car will be emitting.
>[!NOTE]
> All this values are estimates that may or may not be well off the real value, this project has data that is very rounded to make the code simpler and lighter

>[!WARNING]
> This code may not work if you test edge cases such as negative consumptions or distances, so, be carefull when using it, the well running of this code depends entirely on the user.
