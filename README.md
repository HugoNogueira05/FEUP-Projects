# FEUP-Projects
Projects that I've developed alone or with help using what I learned while studiyng at the University.
The objective is to create a project for all the programming languages I've learned during classes, some projects might be more elaborate than others, and most will still be WIP.
Every project has in it's file the starting date aswell as everyone who took part in it's development
Everyone is free to use every code to help in their own projects, but beware that straight plagerism is neither correct nor a good way to learn coding.
I will try to explain every thought process behind the code and try to document it while doing so, to help someone that might be looking for help in that specific topic.
